									<h3>What is the USDA Food Composition Database?</h3>
									<p>Have you ever wondered if you are what you eat? Well, the first step to answer that question is to know what you are eating. This is where the USDA Food Composition Database (NBD) comes into play. It is a database that contains the nutition information for every item the USDA has information on, essentially every food item sold in the US. Ever wondered how many calories are in that Big Mac? No? Really you haven't? Well... if one day you want to know, this is your database of choice.</p>
									<p>Know that you know what the database is your next question is probably "How do I get access to the database?" This is where the API comes into play. So to access the API you ju... What's that? Oh, you don't know what an API is? Ok, hold on one sec...</p>

The machine takes the user's debit card number, contacts the user's bank to verify that there are sufficient funds, and then informs the user whether or not the transaction was approved. This is a complicated process, but all the user needs to know to swipe his or her card. An API works the same way where a software just needs to what to send to the program, swipe the debit card, and what is should be receiving, transaction approved or not. </p>
									<p>API open a world of opportunity to a developer. Chances are the majority of the sites that you have been on today have used an API in some capacity. But the first step is to get your key...</p>
